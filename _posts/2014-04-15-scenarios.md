This week, we have been through a hard time in deciding the project. The NecX project appears to be the most interesting topic for our team as it has the potential of exploring new input technology either for accessibility technology or for improving gaming experience. As for this project is more research based, it’s less promising for this course than the others. Nevertheless, we decide to do it and started our secondary research around the topic.

The first thing we did is investigating all the sensors available on the market which would be used to build our system. Besides, we created a draft version of our product framework as shown below:

We designed three scenarios where we will be focused on building the product: 

* People suffering from spinal cord injury or some birth disorder affecting the neural system cannot move their legs or arms, but they have good control over their upper part of body. Our solution which depends upon neck movement and other features for inputs, can enable them to do certain tasks independently.

* There are many scenarios when our both hands are occupied. Such as while driving a car to carrying groceries. This is where a wearable always-available input technique could become crucial in executing simple tasks.

* The wearable device can also find its way into gaming. With basic input commands maps to some keys, it can be used to play games providing an altogether new experience.

Another possible application is also proposed as backup plan:

Detecting the user’s tiredness using the EMG signal around users’ neck. The human body presents signs when getting tired, it can provide the necessary alert to tell when you need some rest.
