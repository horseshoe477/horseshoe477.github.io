In the third week, we started to summarized our literature review, discuss the framework in detail and finalized our decision on the sensors, board, etc. Meanwhile, we drafted our product requirements document which includes our critical features, performance metrics, technical details and milestones.

The following is our inventory list so far(total ERU 131.75). We have already ordered them and just canâ€™t wait to get hands on.

* [Olimex-328](https://www.olimex.com/Products/Duino/AVR/OLIMEXINO-328/open-source-hardware)  (__x1__)   ERU 21.95

* [Bluetooth module](https://www.olimex.com/Products/Duino/AVR/OLIMEXINO-328/open-source-hardware) (__x1__)   ERU 19.95

* [Shield-EKG-EMK](https://www.olimex.com/Products/Duino/Shields/SHIELD-EKG-EMG/open-source-hardware) (__x3__)   ERU 19.95 x 3 = 59.85

* [EMG Sensors](https://www.olimex.com/Products/Duino/Shields/SHIELD-EKG-EMG-PRO/) (__x3__)   ERU 10 x 3 = 30
