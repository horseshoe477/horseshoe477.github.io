### Signals

* The electric signal is produced during muscle activation, which is observable through the exchange of ions across the muscle membranes and the electrodes attached on the skin.
* EMG signal is acquired through differential amplification.
* sEMG is usually at the range of 5 - 250 Hz (but the cut-off frequency is suggested at 65 - 180 Hz to avoid strong DC at 60 Hz).

### Electrodes
* Ag-AgCl electrodes (pre-gelled) are used in over 80% of surface EMG (sEMG) applications due to its low impedance and high stability
* Placement: 
    * Between the motor unit and the tendinous insertion, along the longitudinal midline of the muscle (fig 9 in [1]).
    * Electrodes should be only 1-2 cm apart.
    * The reference electrode should be placed far from the EMG detecting surface (i.e., on a neutral tissue) â†’ we use bipolar configuration (fig 13 in [1][1])

### Possible noise to sEMG (see more in [2][2])

* Ambient noise (radiated EMI, specifically 50-60 Hz)
* Transducer noise (different impedence between the skin and electrode sensor)

### Other issues

* Consistency in impedance is critical for the reliability of sEMG measurements (think about our form factor)
* Different kind of biosignals - ECG (heart), EEG (brain), EOG (eye) in [3][3]
* Suggestions of electrode placement [3][3]

# Fix bug in RXTX library

* The bug in SerialImp.c causing unnecessary delay (~20ms)
* Modify the sleep time from 20000ms to 2000ms, reducing the delay to ~2ms
* Our ADC sampling rate is 256 Hz (i.e., interval ~3.9ms). The 2ms delay fulfills the system requirement.
