This week, we finally received our order of Olimex-328, EMG sensors and
SHIELD-EKG-EMG! Keyu started building basic blocks based for retrieving data,
based on [Install
OLIMEXINO-328](https://www.olimex.com/Products/Duino/AVR/OLIMEXINO-328/resources/Install_OLIMEXINO-328.pdf)
and [userâ€™s manual for the EMG sensor
board](https://www.olimex.com/Products/Duino/Shields/SHIELD-EKG-EMG/resources/SHIELD-EKG-EMG.pdf).
In the meanwhile, we still need to wait for electrode pads for data collection. 

At the same time, Chaoyu updated the website structure for better demonstrating
the documents and the weekly reports.
